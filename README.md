# yummy-finder

This Web App is to search and save food recipes using Spoonacular API.

This is my second project at Code Academy Berlin that I worked on from scratch, starting from design, choosing API, writing code to deploy.
The aim was to practice JavaScript using API and also CSS framework. I added the Signup, Login/Logout function, and storing data features with Firebase authentication, Firestore, and storage.
I used Materialize to style, and the whole project was done with vanilla JavaScript and Firebase.
